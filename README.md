# Ben's Dumb Twitch Overlay And Chat Bot

it is very good and useful

## How

Get a valid chat token from [this page](https://twitchapps.com/tmi/).

Then make a file called `config.js` with the following contents (replacing values as necessary):

```js
const TWITCH_TOKEN = 'oauth:blahblahyourtoken';
const BOT_NICKNAME = 'benkinsci'; // Must be your Twitch username, all lowercase.
const CHAT_CHANNEL = 'bvisness'; // The bot will join this Twitch channel's chat to listen for messages.
```

Open index.html in a browser for testing, or add the local index.html file as a Browser source in OBS to use as an overlay.
